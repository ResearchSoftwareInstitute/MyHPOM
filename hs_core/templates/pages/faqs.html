                                    <p>TCC is partnering with hospitals, community hospices, AARP and an SECU-supported estate planning law firm to offer a persistent and discoverable online tool for  advance directives and medical information.
                                       The online tool will facilitate the adoption of advance care planning among younger and more diverse populations and will provide the ability for individuals to link their advance care plans and health information to the people named as healthcare agent(s) and others they want to alert to their 
healthcare wishes.
                                       The linkages can be to family, friends, clinicians or other representatives, all chosen by the individual.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Helping others understand your wishes if you are unable to speak for yourself are important. There are state and federal laws that guide how you communicate your wishes to others. There are many terms and documents that describe the instructions you can give your health team, and loved ones to communicate your wishes.  The terms below are the most common ones you may hear.</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong>Advance Directive or Advance Care Plan</strong>- is a legal document that allows a person to communicate health care preferences in the event that he or she is no longer able to make these decisions. This is how you want to be treated if you can't speak for yourself. For example you might not want a feeding tube.</p>
 
                                    <p><strong>Cardiac Arrest</strong>- is the abrupt loss of heart function in a person who may or may not have diagnosed heart disease. The time and reason for death are unexpected. (AHA)</p>

                                    <p><strong>DNR-Do Not Resuscitate-No Code-Desire for a Natural Death</strong>- are all terms that express the desire not to be mechanically kept alive if your heart stops. The DNR tells the health team whether or not you want cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) or to be put on a ventilator to breathe.</p>

                                    <p><strong>End of Life-End of Life (EOL)</strong> is the period of time when a person is approaching the end of life and is expected to die. There is no specific time interval when end-of-life is happening.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Euthanasia-Assisted Suicide</strong>- is the practice of intentionally ending a life in order to relieve pain and suffering. There are different euthanasia laws in the US and vary on a state-by-state basis.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Health Care Proxy</strong>- is a legal document that names another person to legally make healthcare decisions on behalf of the patient, when you are incapable of making and executing the healthcare decisions stipulated in the proxy.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Hospice Care</strong>- is a model for quality, compassionate care for people facing a life-limiting illness or injury. It involves a team-oriented approach to expert medical care, pain management, and emotional and spiritual support expressly tailored to the patient's needs and wishes.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Life-Sustaining Treatment</strong> is the use of available medical machinery and techniques, such as heart-lung machines, ventilators, and other medical equipment and techniques that may keep you alive and possibly let you live longer, but which may not by themselves cure your condition.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Living Will</strong> - is a written expression of how a person wants to be treated in certain medical circumstances. What must be included in the document and what makes it legal varies from state to state.</p>

                                    <p><strong>POLST/MOLST Forms</strong>- POLST stands for Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Therapy. POLST/MOLST forms are specific Medical Orders that tell providers what to do in an emergency. They can accompany a person from home to hospital.  They do not replace an advanced directive or health care proxy.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Natural Death</strong>- is a death that occurs from natural causes, as disease or old age, rather than from violence or an accident.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Organ or Tissue Donation</strong>- gives the health team permission to surgically remove and give your organs or tissues to another person.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Patient Self Determination Act (PSDA)</strong>- is a federal law whose purpose is to ensure that a patient's right to self-determination in health care decisions be communicated and protected. Health care facilities are required by law to honor a patient's wishes and to ask every person seeking care whether they have documents that spell out their wishes.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Palliative Care</strong>- is specialized medical care for people with serious illness. This type of care is focused on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Power of Attorney for Health Care</strong> - is a legal document that names someone that you trust to act as your agent to make health care decisions if you are unable to speak for yourself. There is a second document that names power of attorney for financial matters. They do not have to be the same person.</p>
