MyHPOM is a collaborative website being developed for better access to data and models in the hydrologic sciences. MyHPOM will provide the sustainable technology infrastructure needed to address critical issues related to water quantity, quality, accessibility, and management. MyHPOM will expand the data sharing capability of the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System by broadening the classes of data accommodated, expanding capability to include the sharing of models and model components, and taking advantage of emerging social media functionality to enhance information about and collaboration around hydrologic data and models.

This repository (hs_core) contains the core data model for resources in MyHPOM. If you want to contribute to MyHPOM and/or hs_core, the following links may be helpful:
