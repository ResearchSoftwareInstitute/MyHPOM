    <h4>2. Registration and Responsibilities</h4>
    <p>While certain aspects of the Services are public, others require you to sign up for the Services by registering for an account (an “Account”). You are solely responsible for keeping the email address associated with your Account accurate and up to date, since this is the only way we can contact you about your Account and your use of the Services. You promise not to (i) intentionally impersonate another person by using their name and/or email address or (ii) use an email address for which you don’t have the proper authorization. You must keep your password secure and should never publish, distribute or post your Account login information, because you are responsible for any activity that occurs on your Account.

You select to use the Services by yourself, or, if you are using Mind My Health as Household with another user with whom you share ownership of the Secure Information of your advance directive (each, a “Co-Administrator”). You are prohibited from using another person’s account or registration information for the Services without their permission. You promise to immediately let us know if there is any unauthorized use of your Account, security breach, or change in your eligibility to use the Services. You can delete your Account at any time by logging into your Account and visiting the “Edit Profile” link, where you can click the “Delete My Account” link.</p>

For clarity, the below license grants to us and others does not affect your other ownership or license rights in Your Information, including the right to grant additional licenses to Your Information, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

    <p>i. “Basic Information” means the first and last name, email address, gender, zip code, date of birth, and the date and time of associated with the Account creation and (if applicable) deletion of you or any Collaborator on your account, including Read Or Write Access Viewers or Co-Administrators on your advance directive (each a "Collaborator"). By submitting Basic Information through the Services, you hereby do and shall grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use reproduce, store, and display the Basic Information, including after termination of your Account or the Services, as necessary (1) to operate, provide, and improve the Site, the Services and our (and our successors’ and assigns’) businesses; (2) to send you and your Collaborators marketing and promotional materials with you and your Collaborators’ consent; (3) to contact your Collaborators on your behalf, and (4) for audit purposes (for example, when you delete your Account we will store the Basic Information to address certain inquiries you may have surrounding your Account)&nbsp;</p>

    <p>ii. Secure Information.&nbsp; “Secure Information” means your private, sensitive, personal information that you privately submit through the Services, including your health and medical information, financial information, and legal information. Some of such health and health related information may be considered “Protected Health Information” or “PHI,” as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). By submitting Secure Information through the Services, you hereby do and shall grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, reproduce and display your Secure Information solely as reasonably necessary to operate the Services solely on your behalf, and subject to these Terms and our Privacy Policy located at https://www.mindmyhealth.org/privacy.

In addition, we shall handle your Secure Information in accordance with our obligations under HIPAA as a HIPAA-compliant company. Only you -- or a Co-Administrator (if applicable) -- can give permission to share any of your Secure Information with a Read Or Write Access Viewer.

The only time we may have access to or disclose the content or details of your Secure Information is when you or a Co-Administrator (if applicable) has given the requisite permission to share such Secure Information with a Read or Write Access Viewer as further described herein, when we are required to by Law, or in other rare circumstances as described in our Privacy Policy https://www.mindmyhealth.org/privacy.</p>
    <p>Summary: <strong>We will store your Secure Information and share it only with the Read Or Write Access Viewers you or your Co-Administrator choose or as required by Law. While we can see which portions of the advance directive you have filled out with your Secure Information, we do not in the course of normal operations see what your Secure Information actually says. We work hard to keep your Secure Information private and protected.&nbsp; It is important that you read our Privacy Policy https://www.mindmyhealth.org/privacy, so please do so.</strong></p>

    <p>Summary: <strong>If you receive an advance directive from a healthcare advisor or a Partner Provider, we may surface information on your use of the services back to that advisor or Partner Provider (as applicable), but never the contents of your advance directive or your Secure Information unless you have designated them as a Read or Write Access Viewer for the particular Secure Information you have chosen to share.</strong></p>
    <p>iv. Public Information.&nbsp; “Public Information” means any Content you add, create, upload, submit, distribute or post to public portions of the Services, such as comments on any articles.&nbsp; By publicly posting Public Information to the Services, you hereby do and shall grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, edit, modify, truncate, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, store, display, perform, transmit, and otherwise fully exploit the Public Information in connection with the Services and our (and our successors’ and assigns’) businesses, including without limitation for promoting or redistributing part or all of the Site or the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party websites and feeds), and including after termination of your Account or the Services.&nbsp; You also hereby do and shall grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access your Public Information through the Services, and to use, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such Public Information, including after your termination of your Account or the Services.&nbsp; Please do not publicly post or submit any Content that you do not want publicly accessible or viewable.</p>

Aggregate Information.&nbsp; “Aggregate Information” means statistical information about how you use the Services as well as your demographic information.&nbsp; By submitting or generating Aggregate Information through your use of the Services, you hereby do and shall grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, edit, modify, truncate, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, store, display, perform, transmit and otherwise fully exploit the Aggregate Information in connection with the Site, the Services and our (and our successors’ and assigns’) businesses, including without limitation for promoting or marketing part or all of the Site or the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party websites and feeds), and including after termination of your Account or the Services.&nbsp; To be clear, Aggregate Information is not personally identifiable and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser.</p>
    <p>Summary: <strong>We may use your Aggregate Information to promote our Services, none of which is personally identifiable.</strong></p>
    <p>b. The security, privacy, and confidentiality of your Secure Information are of utmost and critical importance to us. When we collect, maintain, access, use, or disclose your Personal Information, including without limitation your Secured Information, we will do so using systems and processes consistent with information privacy and security requirements under applicable federal and state laws, including, without limitation, HIPAA. Accordingly, we use industry standard (or better) administrative, physical, and technical protections to safeguard the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of your Secure Information, and we store your Secure Information on HIPAA-compliant infrastructure. Except as permitted under this Agreement, we do not share Secure Information with third parties without your express permission. Our technology uses the encryption algorithms of the same quality relied on by banks, the military, and the U.S. government. Your Secure Information is stored in a HIPAA-compliant hosting provider that has 24/7 physical and biometric protections, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and an array of other technological safeguards and security certifications. Nevertheless, no security measure or safeguard is 100% effective, and Mind My Health cannot guarantee absolute security of any of Your Information, including without limitation your Secure Information. Mind My Health SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, HACKING OR OTHER SECURITY INTRUSIONS OR FAILURE TO STORE OR THE THEFT, DELETION, CORRUPTION, DESTRUCTION, DAMAGE, OR LOSS OF ANY DATA OR INFORMATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION SECURE INFORMATION.</p>
    <p>Summary: <strong>We have an experienced team that employs better than industry standard methods to make sure that your Secure Information will be safe, though no security measure can be guaranteed to be 100% effective.</strong></p>

Waiver and Severability.&nbsp; Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms.&nbsp; Waiver of compliance in any particular instances does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future.&nbsp; In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.&nbsp; If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
    </p>
    <p>Summary: <strong>The only valid way for us to waive your compliance with any of this agreement is by written notice from us.&nbsp; If any part of this agreement is found to be invalid, the rest still stands.</strong></p>
