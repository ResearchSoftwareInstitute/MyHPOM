    </p>
    <h3>What types of information does Mind My Health collect, how is it collected, and how does it use it?</h3>
    <h4>1. Personal Information</h4>
    <p>a. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information that uniquely identifies you or any other individual or otherwise contains personally identifiable information provided by or obtained from you or any other user of the Services.&nbsp; Personal Information may include certain types of Basic Information, Secure Information, Read Or Write Access Viewer Information, Access Code Information and Public Information, each of which is described in further detail below.&nbsp; Mind My Health does not share Personal Information with any third party other than as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
        b. “Basic Information” means the first and last name, email address, gender, zip code, date of birth, and the date and time of associated with the Account creation and (if applicable) deletion of you, your Read Or Write Access Viewers, and any Co-Administrators (each a “Collaborator”) on your advance directive. We may use your Basic Information to operate, provide, and improve the Site, the Services and our (and our successors’ and assigns’) businesses, to contact you and (if applicable) your Collaborators to send information about the Services. If you or your Collaborators don’t want to receive email communications from us, follow the “unsubscribe” instructions at the bottom of any email message received from us. That said, there are certain types of important email communications that we need to always be able to send to you and your Collaborators (such as notifications about password changes, permissions changes, or changes to the Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy) for which you may not be given an “unsubscribe” option.&nbsp;<br>
        c. “Secure Information” means your private, sensitive, personal information that you privately submit through the Services, including your health and medical information and legal information. &nbsp;&nbsp;Some of such health and care related information may be considered “Protected Health Information” or “PHI,” as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). While we may know whether and when you submitted a particular type or category of Secure Information, we do not in the course of our standard daily business operations have access to the content or details of any Secure Information you privately submit through the Services because it is encrypted. We will share your Secure Information only with your designated Read Or Write Access Viewer (as defined below) and only pursuant to your, or (if applicable) your Co-Administrator’s, explicit instruction, except when we are required to by law or in other rare circumstances, as described below.<br>
        d. “Use Information” means certain high-level information about your use of and access to the Services that may be visible to a healthcare advisor or Partner Provider if you accepted an Invitation from that healthcare advisor or Partner Provider, as applicable, to sign up for and access the Premium Services (as defined below) (if applicable), which may include the type of advance directive you signed up for, the date and time of your last login to the Services, your total number of logins to the Services, and which sections of your advance directive you completed. We may share your Use Information only with your healthcare advisor (if applicable).
        e. “Public Information” means any personally identifying information you post in any public forum through the Services (e.g., in the comments section below articles).&nbsp; Please remember that any Public Information you post publicly on the Services is not private, and thus may be used or disclosed by any third party who reads such Public Information without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information.&nbsp; Accordingly, please think carefully before publicly posting any Public Information on the Services.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Non-Personal Information</h4>
    <p>a. In contrast to Personal Information, “Non-Personal Information” does not, on its own, uniquely identify you or anyone else as a specific individual, but rather provides technical data, such as information about your interaction with the Services or about your browser. &nbsp;Non-Personal Information may include Aggregate Information, and Cookie Information, each of which is described in further detail below.<br>
        b. “Aggregate Information” means statistical information about how, how often, and when you use the Services and your demographic information. &nbsp;We may use Aggregate Information in order to understand how and how often people use the Services, which in turn allows us to improve them, but never in a way that is personally identifiable.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
        c. “Cookie Information” means information collected via cookies which enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services.&nbsp; Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer through your web browser when you access a website.&nbsp; Our cookies by themselves do not contain Personal Information, and we do not combine Cookie Information with your Personal Information to tell us who you are.<br>
        i. While many browsers have an option to turn off the cookie feature (which may prevent your browser from accepting any new cookie or may allow you to decide which cookie to accept from any website on a case-by-case basis), we strongly recommend that you leave cookies active because the Cookie Information we derive enables us to provide you with the most advantageous and attractive features of the Services.&nbsp;
        ii. Please note, however, that this Privacy Policy only covers our use of cookies and Cookie Information, and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.&nbsp; Certain third party vendors use cookies in certain unrestricted publicly-available parts of our Site to provide analytical data and target and serve ads based on your prior visits to Site and use of the Services.&nbsp; We do not control when or how a third party places cookies on your computer.

    <h4>6. Sharing pursuant to applicable law</h4>
    <p>a. Other than sharing with Read Or Write Access Viewers, Agents or Acquirers as described above, we can only share Personal Information, including your Secure Information, in the limited circumstances described below relating to your abuse or misuse of the Services or legal process.<br>
        b. If we believe that you have misused or abused the Services or the Personal Information of any other user, or have attempted to interfere with or harm the Services, we will investigate and cooperate with appropriate law enforcement officials, which may include sharing your Basic Information with them in order to protect our rights or property or that of other users, Read Or Write Access Viewers, Agents, and others.&nbsp; We will give our full cooperation in any legal process or criminal investigation into any misuse or abuse of the Services.<br>
        c. We may also share your Personal Information solely to the extent required by law to comply with a subpoena or analogous legal process or governmental request; while this may include certain of your Secure Information, rest assured that we will never willingly share any of your Secure Information unless required by law.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We may also share your Personal Information as otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property or that of other users, Read Or Write Access Viewers, Agents and others.<br>
        d. We will promptly notify you if we receive any request for your Personal Information or Secure Information from any governmental entity or other third party pursuant to a subpoena or analogous legal process before sharing any such requested information, unless we are legally prohibited from so notifying you or we have a good faith reason to believe that such sharing is or may be necessary to protect someone’s life, avoid serious physical injury or property loss or damage, or to prevent or investigate any ongoing crime.<br>
        e. As discussed in the Terms at https://www.mindmyhealth.org/legal, no fiduciary duty is or will ever be created between you and Mind My Health by virtue of you using the Services.&nbsp; Accordingly, while communications between you and us are protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy, they are not protected by the physician-patient privilege, doctor-patient confidentiality, attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, or any other fiduciary duty.

    <h3>How does Mind My Health protect, safeguard and secure the information it collects?</h3>
    <p>The security, privacy and confidentiality of your Personal Information is of utmost and critical importance to us, which is why we have implemented a variety of industry standard (or better) administrative, physical and technical protections to safeguard the security, privacy, confidentiality and integrity of your Personal Information, including without limitation your Secure Information.&nbsp;</p>

Accordingly, your Secure Information is stored in a HIPAA-compliant hosting provider that has 24/7 physical and biometric protections, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and an array of other technological safeguards and security certifications.</p>
