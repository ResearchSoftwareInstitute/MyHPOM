This content is rendered inside a .advance-directive-widget element,
which is rendered inside the dashboard template to provide an
anchor for the jQuery code to attach live-loaded HTML to.
(This could also conceivably be appended to the container,
but it is clearer what's happening if there is an element
in the template that represents the entry-point.)
