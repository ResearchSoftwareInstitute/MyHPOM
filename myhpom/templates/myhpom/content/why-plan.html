                        An <em>advance directive</em> is a legal document which
                        allows you to record your healthcare wishes in case you can
                        no longer speak for yourself. These documents can also be
                        combined with Power of Attorney documents and are used by
                        medical professionals as well as family and caregivers to
                        ensure your decisions are heard and respected.

                    <div class="mt-3 why-plan-bigimg__text">
                        People are owning their healthcare more than ever
                        before. Whether through health-related internet
                        searches or health tracking apps, more and more
                        people are taking steps to play an active role in
                        making their health decisions. Setting up an advance
                        care plan is another tool for taking ownership of
                        your healthcare. It lets you document your decisions
                        for what kind of care you want if you could not
                        speak for yourself. A recent national survey found
                        that 90% of Americans think discussing your
                        healthcare preferences if you canâ€™t speak for
                        yourself is important, but <em>fewer than 30% have
                        taken steps to do so</em>. By going ahead and making
                        your plan, you make sure your healthcare will
                        align with your values and decisions no matter
                        what life throws your way.

                        Communication between patients and doctors is

                        wishes for your healthcare better than anyone else.
                        But what if you cannot discuss your wishes with
                        your healthcare team? When you create an advance
                        care plan you provide a direction that can help
                        guide your treatment and prevent your healthcare
                        team from having to guess what care you want.
                        That way your voice can always stay central
                        to your care.

                        Discussing your healthcare wishes with your loved ones
                        can be challenging. But sharing your healthcare
                        decisions with close family and friends is one of the
                        best ways to guarantee your wishes will be known and
                        honored. Making an advance care plan does not only
                        benefit you. It can also help those closest to you
                        feel empowered to act as an advocate on your behalf
                        no matter what. Giving them the knowledge of your
                        choices can reduce their stress so that they can work
                        with healthcare providers more confidently to manage
                        your care in a way that aligns with your values.
